title: "Why Prototype?"

teaser: "Why prototyping using web tech still matters in the era of generative AI"
tags:

- different types of prototypes:

  - animation & motion
  - data focused / driven (interactive dashboard)
  - visual fidelity (responsive design falls in this category)
  - interaction / task completion (UI for a keyboard shortcut customization)
  - kitchen sink (some or all of the above)

- why it's best to avoid the kitchen sink but also why it can be useful in certain times

- benefits:

  - saving eng time by bringing clarity and certainty prior to building
  - avoiding having to redo prod code work later
  - risk mitigation
  - aligning people on what is being built
  - addressing rift in design & eng
  - use both design and dev skills

- helpful to identify a clear set of pain points that prototyping is meant to address

- difference between prototyping to figure out a technical issue vs a UX one
- "build the thing right" vs "build the right thing"

- experience as a UXE at Google
  - collaborating with designers, product managers, and researchers
  - role was unique: full time prototyping
  - used web tech: html, css, js, react
  - used real data
  - 311 data when real data couldn't be acquired due to privacy concerns
  - creating new data visualization types
  - user testing for accessibility

questions:

- ask if there is room for more design thinking & product thinking?

- does prototyping work make sense for a human to do now that we can use generative AI for it?

- trade off of shipping quickly vs longer investment and shipping later:

  - e.g. a backend feature that requires a UI component, but it's not clear what that UI component should look like
  - backend dev is costly, so having a prototype showing what the UX should be can be helpful
