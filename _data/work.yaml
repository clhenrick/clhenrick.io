    Heatmap visualization of (almost) every Luckyduck Bicycle Café shop bicycle ride for Guerilla
    Cartography's *Flow* project.
  description_long: |-
    [Luckyduck Bicycle Café](https://www.facebook.com/LuckyduckOak/) was a much loved café and bike shop located in downtown Oakland, California which closed in April of 2023 after serving a loyal following for seven years. Part of Luckyduck's allure was holding weekly group shop bike rides that meandered through various parts of the East Bay and sometimes north into Marin County or west into San Francisco.

    To commemorate the end of an era for many members of Oakland's local cycling community, I created this heat map of every shop bicycle ride that I could source geospatial data for from [RideWithGPS](https://ridewithgps.com/), a popular cycling planning app. On Saturday, October 19th, 2024 as part of the "Atlas at a Conference" project pitched by [Guerrilla Cartography](https://www.guerrillacartography.org) during the North American Cartographic Information Society's annual conference, I downloaded GPX route data for each shop ride from the [Luckyduck RideWithGPS account](https://ridewithgps.com/users/54142) via a [NodeJS script](https://github.com/clhenrick/luckyduck-shop-rides/tree/main). I then created the heat map visualization in the Chrome web browser using D3JS, HTML Canvas, and CSS. The shaded relief depicting the topography of the Bay Area near Oakland was created via repurposed code from my [Open Source Oakland Map](/work/open-source-oakland-map/) project. Darin Jensen of Guerrilla Cartography contributed some of the final touches such as framing the map, and adding descriptive text and a legend to make it more suitable for print publication. This map will be included in the forthcoming book by Guerrilla Cartography, *Flow*.

  description_long: |-
    A minimal reference map of Oakland, California primarily for use as a background image for this website's [home](/) and [about](/about/) pages. The map is available in both light and dark color scheme variants to support the light and dark themes of this website. The map was created using two separate processes: one for sourcing and processing of the geographic data; the second for rendering the map using the data. Geographic data wrangling was accomplished using a Makefile to programmatically run tasks that query data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) using the OSM [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) and transform and manipulate it using a combination of the [GDAL](https://gdal.org/en/latest/)'s `ogr2ogr` program and the [Mapshaper](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper) JavaScript library. The shaded relief portion of the map that is visible to the right / east of the map was created using [NED DEM data](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/national-elevation-dataset) and GDAL's `hillshade` program. Rendering of the map itself was accomplished using a combination of JavaScript, [D3JS](https://d3js.org/) (in particular [d3-geo](https://d3js.org/d3-geo)), SVG, HTML Canvas, and CSS in a web browser. The final map image was created using [headless Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromium/headless) to capture a screenshot the map and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) to crop the image.

    Web application design and development for exploratory climate data visualization and analysis pertaining to the state of California.
  description_long: |-
    Cal-Adapt is both a complex web application and content rich website that enables users to access climate data for California in the form of over a dozen interactive data visualization dashboards, data download formats, and educational content.

    Cal-Adapt's frontend is a static site that interfaces with the backend through a RESTful API which is responsible for serving climate data. The majority of the project's content is stored as Markdown files which are rendered to HTML serverside during the build process, making the page load times fast. Deployment is handled using a NodeJS script that enables deploying to various environments (production, development, beta, Netlify) utilizing feature flags to include or disable various features per environment.

    From 2021 through 2022, Cal-Adapt underwent both a redesign and code refactor to address usability issues and technical debt. I assisted with this effort, both in the UX design and frontend development. For this process we utilized Figma for designing UI mocks, SvelteJS as the frontend framework, SapperJS for SPA like functionality, D3JS and Layer Cake for interactive charts, MapBoxGLJS for interactive geo-visualizations, and the Carbon Design system and component library for the user interface.

    Cal-Adapt is the result of a collaboration between members of UC Berkeley's [Geospatial Innovation Facility](http://gif.berkeley.edu/), including [Shruti Mukhtyar](https://twitter.com/mapchitra), Brian Galey, Eric Lehmer, Lucy Andrews, and Nancy Thomas and [Eagle Rock Analytics](http://www.eaglerockanalytics.com/) with grant funding and directional support provided by the [California State Energy Commission](https://www.energy.ca.gov/) and the [Governor's Office of Planning and Research](https://www.opr.ca.gov/).

    Website visual design was done using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), mainly for creating basic mocks and a style guide, while the rest of the design process, including content design, was accomplished using Markdown, HTML, and CSS in collaboration with the Analytics Engine team. Reusable patterns and UI components were developed to enable the site to grow organically over time with little additional developer effort. The website is built using the [Astro](https://astro.build/) static site generator, which uses the concept of "partial hydration" to keep client-side JavaScript to a minimum. CAE Jupyter Notebooks were converted to Markdown using Jupyter's [nbconvert](https://pypi.org/project/nbconvert/) utility, allowing for the fast loading and previewing of notebook contents in the site's documentation pages.

    During the second half of 2020, I and a cohort of Googlers took part in a [Google.org](https://www.google.org/) fellowship in partnership with [Morehouse School of Medicine](https://msm.edu/)'s [Satcher Health Leadership Institute](https://satcherinstitute.org/) to develop the [Health Equity Tracker web application](https://healthequitytracker.org). My role in the fellowship was to prototype data visualizations that highlighted health disparities using datasets that were identified as relevant to communicating health outcomes and the social determinants of health.

    The results of this work are dozens of [Observable Notebooks](https://observablehq.com/) that are organized into two collections; one for [data analysis and exploration](https://observablehq.com/collection/@clhenrick/msm-fellowship-data-intake) and another for [data visualization prototyping](https://observablehq.com/collection/@clhenrick/msm-fellowship). Some visualizations from these notebooks were embedded as [stand alone web pages](https://satcherinstitute.github.io/data-visualization/) for user experience research with health equity advocates who work in various sectors of public health across the U.S. and partner with SHLI. Below are some sample visualizations from the Observable Notebooks and notebook embeds.

    In the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic, the [Anti-Eviction Mapping Project](https://antievictionmap.com/) in collaboration with tenants rights and other activist groups tirelessly researched and documented emergency tenant protections and housing justice actions in response to the economic and housing crises stemming from COVID-19. The result of that effort is the COVID-19 Tenant Protections Map, an interactive web mapping and story telling application. It enabled viewers to search for legislation that affects their rights as a renter at the city, county, state/province, and national levels of government in the United States and abroad. The site also served as a crowdsourcing mechanism that encouraged viewers to submit local updates on emergency tenants rights legislation and housing justice actions. The content of the site was translated to a number of different languages and loads based on the language setting of the viewer's browser.

    I contributed cartographic design and web development to this project on a pro-bono basis during Spring and Summer of 2020 in the early days of the Coronavirus pandemic. The making of this map was a highly collaborative process involving many members of AEMP, tenants rights groups, and partnering activist collectives. It is the result of many hours of hard work, coordination, consensus building, and dedication from those involved in creating and contributing to a months long endeavor.

    The NYC Crash Mapper's chart view is a data exploration tool that allows users to filter, compare, rank, and view trends in vehicle collision data reported by the NYPD. The "Trend" view allows you to compare two selected areas’ performance against each other and to a citywide or borough-wide reference, while filtering by date range or type of crash. "Compare" lets you compare two time periods for a given area. "Rank" shows where one area ranks in terms of safety in the context of all similar areas over the most recent three-year period. "Map" will show the geo location of the crashes using the first area selected, date range of period A, and any applied crash type filters.

    The "chart view" was phase two of the [original NYC Crash Mapper project](/work/nyc-crash-mapper/) which featured only an interactive map and some basic statistics for the current map view. NYC Crash Mapper began as a consultant project of mine, then was further developed to include interactive charting components during my tenure at [GreenInfo Network](http://greeninfo.org). NYC Crash Mapper was featured on the infamous [NYC Streets Blog](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/03/08/map-the-dangerous-streets-in-your-neighborhood-with-this-new-tool/).

  description_long: |-
    NYC Crash Mapper is a web application that dynamically maps, analyzes, and filters vehicle collision data reported by the NYPD in New York City from 2011 to present. The web app allows a user to select a date range for when crashes occurred, filter the data by crash type (injury or fatality; pedestrian, cyclist, or motorist), filter by administrative boundary, or filter by a custom area using a drawing tool. Specific “views” of the data can be shared with other users via URL query parameters which contain the map's zoom and center, and any applied filters. Data from the app may be downloaded in various formats such as CSV, Shapefile, and GeoJSON. New collision data is updated to the app’s database weekly using an ETL script running on a Heroku Scheduler. [Chekpeds](http://chekpeds.com), a non-profit that advocates for pedestrian safety in Hell’s Kitchen, funded the work on the app through a grant from New York City. In addition to developing the app, I designed the user interface using Adobe Illustrator.

- title: Am I Rent Stabilized?
  tags:

  description: A civic web application that informs New York City tenants about rent stabilization in a user friendly, step by step process.
  description_long: |-
    *Am I Rent Stabilized?* is a web application that encourages New York City tenants to find out if their landlord may be illegally overcharging them for a rent stabilized apartment and if so, motivates them to take action. It is an attempt at using open data as a prompt for civic action, rather than solely for visualization and analysis. The app asks the user to input their address and checks it against a database of properties that are likely to have rent stabilized apartments. From here the app recommends a course of action and informs the user of their nearest tenants rights group so they can get help if desired. The app features a responsive interface that is mobile friendly, and its content can be toggled to either Spanish or Chinese for non-english speakers.

    I developed *Am I Rent Stabilized?* as my thesis project for the [Parsons Master in Fine Arts Design and Technology](https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/) program at the New School in 2015. The project evolved from quantitative and qualitative research into housing issues in New York City and my own lived experience with New York state's rent-stabilization program.

    I'm gratefully indebted to those who assisted me with the project:

    - [Caroline Woolard](http://carolinewoolard.com/) for suggesting the concept to me.
    - [Jue Yang](https://github.com/jueyang) designed the graphics which informed the overall redesign of version 2 of the site.
    - [Eric Brelsford](http://ebrelsford.github.io/portfolio/) and [BetaNYC](http://betanyc.us/) provided motivational and technical support.
    - [Radish Lab](http://radishlab.com/) contributed the design mockups for version 2.
    - [John Krauss](http://blog.johnkrauss.com/) provided additional data for NYC properties that should have rent-stabilized apartments due to receiving tax exemptions from state programs such as 421a.

  description: Open source, global terrain web map tile design and development for Stamen Design.
  description_long: >-
    [Terrain Classic](http://maps.stamen.com/terrain/) is a set of free, open-source, global [web map tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map) covering web map zoom levels 0 to 18 that depict [topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography) using a cartography technique called "[shaded relief](http://www.shadedrelief.com/)." These map tiles were created from various open data sources such as [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org), [Natural Earth Vector data](http://naturalearthdata.com), [MODIS landcover](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mcd12q1), and [Digital Elevation Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model). This style was inspired by the original Stamen Terrain map tiles which previously only covered the United States. The style was ported from Cascadenik to CartoCSS, a CSS like markup language used for styling geographic data to create tiled web maps using a renderer such as Mapnik. I assisted Stamen Design members Alan McConchie and Seth Fitzsimmons with creating the map style, including line work, labeling, color, and the shaded relief.

    A print map I created for Rebecca Solnit's city atlas [Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520285958/nonstop-metropolis). I pitched the map idea to Rebecca while meeting her and atlas co-author Joshua Jelly-Schapiro for coffee at Caffè Reggio near Washington Square one afternoon and a collaborative engagement for bringing the map to life ensued. In order to to create this map open data was utilized from sources such as NYC's open data portal and OpenStreetMap. Data was queried and transformed using SQL via GDAL, PostgreSQL, and PostGIS. The final cartographic design was accomplished "by hand" using Adobe Illustrator and MAPublisher.

  description_long: |-
    The Northwest Bushwick Community Map is a web based resource for local community organizations and tenants rights groups to easily access disparate information around land use, housing, and urban development for the neighborhood of Bushwick in Brooklyn, New York. It is intended to be a tool to inform residents about what kinds of indicators may be used to predict new urban development and help prevent displacement of longterm residents in their own neighborhoods.

    The project was originally conceptualized by Michael "Ziggy" Mintz and Brigette Blood of the Northwest Bushwick Community Group. It was later redesigned and further developed by myself, Gabriel Gianordoli, Daniel Mastretta, and Namreta Kumar of the Parsons MFA DT class of 2015 in collaboration with Ziggy and Brigette.

    The NAG Greenpoint-Williamsburg ToxiCity Map is an interactive map of toxic “hot spots” in Greenpoint and Williamsburg. Data used to compile this map came from city, state, and federal sources, guided by on-the-ground knowledge from local activists. Data layers on the map assist in conveying neighborhood trends such as population density and asthma hospital visits, and locating specific sites such as the former NuHart Plastics factory and the Exxon oil spill. Additionally, sites that have already been remediated and sites that require future remediation are included on this map.

    This project was created in collaboration with Bowon Chung and Jessie Braden at Pratt's [Spatial Analysis and Visualization Initiative](https://www.pratt.edu/research/provosts-centers/spatial-analysis-visualization-initiative/) and with members of [North Brooklyn Neighbors](https://nag-brooklyn.org).

  description_long: >-
    An important requirement of the FOSI GRID website's redesign was enabling users to navigate the site's content via an interactive map. To accomplish this I created custom geospatial data from [Natural Earth's 1:50m resolution vector data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/) and rendered it using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com), a popular open-source web mapping library. Region polygon data was made using MAPublisher, and admin0 & admin1 polygons were created using PostGIS. To make data loading faster I converted the data to TopoJSON format to store ten different layers consisting of region polygons, countries grouped by region, and states / provinces grouped by country. When data is added to the map it is converted from TopoJSON to GeoJSON. This cut down drastically on AJAX requests and the website's initial load time. Coordination between the project's two Ruby on Rails developers was necessary to link the CMS database with the map's UI interactions.

  description_long: >-
    *Ten and Taller* is part of an online and gallery exhibition for the [Skyscraper Museum of NYC](http://skyscraper.org). The museum's goal for the project was to honor the work of architect & historian Don Friedman, the author of *Structure in Skyscrapers: History and Preservation*, in the form of an interactive map. The Museum staff digitized tabular data from Friedman's book and traced the corresponding building footprints for each of the 249 structures using a digitized Bromley Atlas map from 1909. My job was to show the footprints on both a historic and modern day map (the latter was designed by the Museum) and to create interactions such as popups that display data from the Friedman book as well as historic photos of the building. To accomplish this I had to create the map tiles for the basemap layers, as well as generate the GeoJSON overlay of the footprint data. Another requirement was for the UI to enable the user to filter which buildings are displayed by their year built via a slider. There is an animation on page load demonstrating this as well. The screenshots below are from a working prototype.

My responsibility was converting an excel table of resources to JSON, coding the user interface, and providing interaction design advice to Radish Lab's designers.

    About the Citywide guide:

    "Women Creating Change (formerly Women's City Club of New York) is proud to provide the online Citywide Guide to Services and Resources in New York. This Guide is designed to help individuals and organizations access needed low- or no-cost social services, programs, and resources available throughout the five boroughs of New York City. Most entries include address, phone number and website, as well as the neighborhood and community board in which the agency is located."

    "Whether searching for jobs or schools, child care or health care, food or transportation, users can initiate custom searches by   typing in key words. It is also possible to narrow searches by selecting a borough and choosing from the drop down list of categories. Search results may be printed for convenience."

    A proof of concept interactive web game created as part of a JavaScript course I took during the Parsons MFA Design and Technology program in 2014. The front-end consists of HTML, CSS, JQuery, and LeafletJS for rendering the user interface while the backend utilized NodeJS, MongoDB, and ExpressJS. [Geographic neighborhood boundary data for NYC](https://github.com/blackmad/zetashapes/blob/master/samples/nyc-pediacities-neighborhoods-polygon-v2.geojson) was sourced from [PediaCities](https://blog.externetworks.com/empowering-smart-cities-with-open-data-by-pediacities/).

      The video begins by showing a user interface containing an interactive geographic map of neighborhood boundaries in NYC, color coded by borough, and a sidebar with the title of the game and the text "You haven't played yet. Guess some NYC hoods!". As the user moves their mouse cursor over a neighborhood boundary on the map it is highlighted in yellow. Clicking on a neighborhood boundary on the map reveals a popup where a user may enter the name of that neighborhood in a text input. Pressing the enter key or clicking the "guess" button submits their guess and checks it against the name of the neighborhood in the database. If the user prefers a hint prior to guessing they can click on the "need a hint?" button in the popup which will show them a partially obscured name of the neighborhood.

      As the user submits guesses, their attempts are displayed on a sidebar on the lefthand side of the page and their score is updated. Correct attempts are color coded blue, and incorrect guesses are color coded red. A correct guess results in the neighborhood boundary disappearing from the map. The sidebar is updated to inform the user of their correct guesses against total guesses, and the number of neighborhoods left to guess in the game (there are a total of 309 NYC neighborhoods in the database). A button in the sidebar allows the user to start over and play again.

      At a certain point in the video the Terminal app is displayed showing logs of the user's guesses to the local webserver and data being passed to the local database to store the user's game play.

  description_long: |
    As part of an exercise in creating a multi-dimensional scatterplot, I plotted data sourced from the [World Bank's Indicators](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator) on Gross National Income (GNI) along the x-axis and Carbon Dioxide output on the y-axis for all countries that data was available for using the creative coding software [Processing](https://processing.org).

    Each circle represents a single country, is sized by that country's population, and is colored by the world region the country belongs to (according to the World Bank). Hovering over a circle reveals a tooltip showing the country name, region, and values for GNI and CO2. The scatterplot's x axis may be toggled between Gross National Income and Per Capita Income. The result shows a strong linear correlation between the x and y variables: as income increases so does CO2 output.

    This project was inspired by [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling)'s infamous Ted Talk [*The Best Statistics You've Ever Seen*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w) and his [Gap Minder](https://www.gapminder.org) project.

A yellow dot appears in the San Francisco Bay Area on the west coast of the country with the date Thursday May 16, 2013 to its upper right. Slowly the dot moves subtly, almost as if it is being jiggled, while the date shown next to the dot progresses day by day through May into June. Pink areas are shown representing the dot's previous locations. Around mid June the dot moves southward in California and then abruptly appears in the East Coast near the border of New Jersey and New York with the date Saturday June 13, 2013. The dot then quickly moves south through New Jersey into Maryland, then back to the New York area on June 14, 2013. It then continues to move subtly again, this time around the New York City metro area, not straying far from the city. At August 7, 2013 the yellow dot disappears, leaving a trail of pink in its previous locations in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.
